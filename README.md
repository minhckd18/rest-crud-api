# rest-crud-api
This is my first project during my study of Spring 6 + Spring boot 3.

The target is to create an RESTful API connecting to a MySQL database.
Full CRUD features include:
1. Read one student
2. Read all students
3. Add a student
4. Update a student
5. Delete a student

MySQL script named "employee-directory.sql" is used to create the original database.
