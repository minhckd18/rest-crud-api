# rest-crud-api
This is my first project during my study of Spring 6 + Spring boot 3.

The target is to create an RESTful API connecting to a MySQL database.
Full CRUD features include:
1. Read one employee
2. Read all employees
3. Create a new employee
4. Update an employee
5. Delete an employee

"employee-directory.sql" is used to create the original database.

This project is from a udemy course named "Spring Boot 3: Learn Spring 6, Spring REST API, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, JPA & Hibernate" by Chad Darby.
